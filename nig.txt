Kikes and bohunks and wops,

Dagos and niggers and crackers... 

Starved and lousy,

Blind and stinking -

We fought each other, 

Killed each other,

Because the great white masters 

Played us against each other.

Then a kike said: Workers of the world, unite! 

And a dago said: Let us live!

And a cracker said: Ours for us!

And a nigger said: Walk together, children!
